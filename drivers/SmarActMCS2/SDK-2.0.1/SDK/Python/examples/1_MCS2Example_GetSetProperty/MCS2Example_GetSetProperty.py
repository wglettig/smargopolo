# MCS2 devices are identified with locator strings, similar to URLs used to locate web pages.

# usb:sn:<serial>       - where <serial> is the device serial which is printed on the housing of the device.
#                        Example: usb:sn:MCS2-00000412
# usb:ix:<n>            - where the number <n> selects the nth device in the list of all currently attached
#                        devices with a USB interface. Example: usb:ix:0.
# network:sn:<serial>   - where <serial> is the device serial which is printed on the housing of the device.
#                        Example: network:sn:MCS2-00000412
# network:192.168.1.200 - where <ip> is an IPv4 address which consists of four integer numbers between 0 and 255
#                        separated by a dot. Example: network:192.168.1.200
# It is possible to list all available devices using the "FindDevices" function.
# This is shown in the further examples. Here we simply use a fixed locator string.

# Note that there is no explicit communication mode (like synchronous or asynchronous)
# the user must decide upon, as it was in the previous controller systems.
# The application may decide on a per-call basis which method to use,
# thus being very flexible depending on the applications context.

# Before being able to communicate with a device it must be initialized with a call to "Open".
# This function connects to the device specified in the locator parameter and returns a handle to the
# device, if the call was successful. The returned device handle must be saved within the application
# and passed as a parameter to the other API functions. Once the connection is established,
# all the other functions may be used to interact with the connected device.
# Note: the additional configuration parameter is unused for now.
# The "Open" function returns the handle which must be passed to all functions to address the device.

    # Modifying or retrieving property values takes a major role in controlling a device by software.
    # Therefore, the API offers a variety of functions to get and set property values in order to meet all
    # requirements an application might have.

    # Basically there are GetProperty and SetProperty functions for the datatypes "string", "i32" (signed 32bit integer)
    # and "i64" (signed 64bit integer). The "i32" and "i64" versions may be used to process a single value
    # as well as an array of values.
    # Depending on the data type of the specific property, the corresponding variant of the the function must be used.
    # See the MCS2 Programmers Guide for a list of properties and their data types.
    # The passed "idx" parameter specifies the addressed module or channel depending on the specific property.
    # For system properties this parameter is unused and must be set to zero.
    # The "property key" defines the actual property. The predefined keys from the ctl.Property enum can be used.
    # The following code shows how to read several properties with different datatypes.

    # The easiest method to get a property value is the synchronous (blocking) read
    # consisting of only one simple function call.

    # First we read the device serial number which is a string property using "GetProperty_s".
    # Note that for string properties the ioArraySize must be explicitly passed as argument
    # (ctl.STRING_MAX_LENGTH+1) to specify the buffer size for the returned value.

    for channel in range(no_of_channels):
        state = ctl.GetProperty_i32(d_handle, channel, ctl.Property.CHANNEL_STATE)
        # The returned channel state holds a bit field of several state flags.
        # See the MCS2 Programmers Guide for the meaning of all state flags.
        # We pick the "sensorPresent" flag to check if there is a positioner connected
        # which has an integrated sensor.
        # Note that in contrast to previous controller systems the controller supports
        # hotplugging of the sensor module and the actuators.

    # For the following steps we need a positioner connected to channel 0.
    channel = 0

    # First we want to know if the configured positioner type is a linear or a rotatory type.
    # For this purpose we can read the base unit property.
    base_unit = ctl.GetProperty_i32(d_handle, channel, ctl.Property.POS_BASE_UNIT)

    # Next we read the current position of channel 0. Position values have the data type int64,
    # thus we need to use "getProperty_i64".
    # Note that there is no distinction between linear and rotatory positioners regarding the functions which
    # need to be used (getPosition / getAngle) and there is no additional "revolutions" parameter for rotatory positioners
    # as it was in the previous controller systems.
    # Depending on the preceding read base unit, the position is in pico meter [pm] for linear positioners
    # or nano degree [ndeg] for rotatory positioners.
    # Note: it is also possible to read the base resolution of the unit using the property key "POS_BASE_RESOLUTION".
    # To keep things simple this is not shown in this example.

    # the controller and the reply was received.

    # Now we want to read the the position again (and the channel state in addition).
    # This time we use the asynchronous (non-blocking) method.
    # This method requires two function calls for getting one property value.
    # One for requesting the property value and one for retrieving the answer.
    # The advantage of this method is that the application may request several property values in fast
    # succession and then perform other tasks before blocking on the reception of the results.

    # Received values can later be accessed via the obtained request ID and the corresponding ReadProperty functions.

    # The tHandle parameter is used for output buffering with the CreateOutputBuffer and FlushOutputBuffer functions.
    # (Not shown in this example.) By passing the transmit handle the request is associated with the output buffer
    # and therefore only sent when the buffer is flushed.

    # For property writes the result is only used to report errors. With the call-and-forget mechanism
    # the device does not generate a result for writes and the application can continue processing other
    # tasks immediately. Compared to asynchronous accesses, the application doesn’t need to keep
    # track of open requests and collect the results at some point. This mode should be used with care
    # so that written values are within the valid range.
    # The call-and-forget mechanism is activated by passing "False" to the optional pass_rID parameter of the
    # RequestWriteProperty_x functions.
