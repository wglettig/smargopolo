                MCS2 software for Linux
                (c) 2018 by SmarAct GmbH
            ================================


The MCS2 software for Linux contains software development kits
for C/C++ and Python as well as software drivers required to operate
an MCS2 under Linux.

The software provides an installer script for installing certain
components to system directories and/or user-specified locations.
For instructions how to use the installer please refer to the
document `doc/Installing SmarAct Linux Software.txt`.

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
From version 2.1.0 on, the installation process has changed. Previous
versions of installer for Linux installed the software at `/usr`. 
Starting with version 2.1.0, the software is installed at 
`/usr/local` by default, if no installation directory is specifed.
If you have installed MCS2 software before, we recommend
uninstalling it with the old installer before installing the new 
software to avoid mixing old and new software versions on your system.
