# CALIBRATION
# The calibration sequence is used to increase the precision of the position calculation. This function
# should be called once for each channel if the mechanical setup changes.
# (e.g. a different positioner was connected to the channel, the positioner type was set to a different type)
# The calibration data will be saved to non-volatile memory, thus it is not necessary to perform the calibration sequence
# on each initialization.
# Note: the "ChannelState.IS_CALIBRATED" in the channel state can be used to determine
# if valid calibration data is stored for the specific channel.

# During the calibration sequence the positioner performs a movement of up to several mm, make sure to not start
# the calibration near a mechanical endstop in order to ensure proper operation.
# See the MCS2 Programmers Guide for more information on the calibration.

    # The "ChannelState.CALIBRATING" flag in the channel state can be monitored to determine
    # the end of the calibration sequence.

# FIND REFERENCE
# Since the position sensors work on an incremental base, the referencing sequence is used to
# establish an absolute positioner reference for the positioner after system startup.
# Note: the "ChannelState.IS_REFERENCED" in the channel state can be used to to decide
# whether it is necessary to perform the referencing sequence.
